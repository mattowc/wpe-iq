						<h4>Discover the Power of Neuroplasticity: The Brain’s ability to heal itself.</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Reading difficulties a thing of the past</li>
							<li>Why treat when you can cure?</li>
							<li>Eliminate your child’s reading Barrier of Dyslexia</li>
							<li>Give your child a boost in confidence</li>
							<li>Propel their learning for their Future without a disability</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
						</p>
						<p>
							Did you know your brain can heal itself? Your brain works by using interconnecting neurons. Learning disorders, such as dyslexia, exist when these connections are weak or underdeveloped.
						</p>
						<p>
							Neuroplasticity describes the brain’s ability to restructure itself by forming new neural connections. Recent research shows that these connections can be strengthened through specific brain-training exercises. Dyslexia occurs when a person’s Directional Discrimination is not properly functioning. The most common symptoms are letter and word reversals: p for q, d for b, mom for wow, etc.  Once the weak connections that result in dyslexia are strengthened, symptoms will fade.
						</p>
						<h4>How do I strengthen weak neural connections?</h4>

						<h1>How The Brain Works</h1>
						<img src="assets/img/brain-apple.jpeg" />
						<h4>Learning occurs in 2 phases:</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Sensory Input</li>
							<li>Neurological Processing</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							The first phase, sensory input, refers to all the information gathered by our senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Schools and tutors try to help kids learn by providing sensory data loaded with information.  They will use sight in the form of notes and diagrams; they will use sound in the form of lectures and explanations; they may even use touch through demonstrations that call for class participation.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order for this sensory data to make sense, our brains must process it. Our brain processes information by sending sensory data along neurological connections to the appropriate lobe. When these connections are not properly developed, the affected person exhibits a learning disorder. Schools do not address the processing aspect of learning.
						</p>
						<p>
							20% of children have trouble with the neurological phase: they can’t turn teaching into learning. This is where IQ-Express steps in.

						<h1>Why IQ-Express?</h1>

						<p>
						</p>
						<p>
							The reason some kids have trouble with the neurological phase of learning is that the wiring in parts of their brain is not fully developed. This does not have to be a permanent condition.

						  	The reason so many educational resources fail is that they do not understand the root of the learning disability. The problem lies in underdeveloped neuroconnections. Once we develop these connections, all else falls into place. IQ-Express offers a permanent solution with unending returns. <strong>Within 6 months’ time, the average student gains 2 years worth of learning capacity.</strong>

						  <div class="tab-pane" id="second-tab">
							For over two decades, John Heath’s team of dedicated researchers and learning specialists have gathered and analyzed brain-related research as it pertains to learning difficulties. We’ve lectured from Kansas to California and were even invited to present our findings at an international learning disability conference held at Oxford University. <strong>We understand the concept of neuroplasticity and how to harness the brain’s power to adapt.</strong>
						  </div>
						  <div class="tab-pane" id="third-tab">
						  	We made such a splash in the field of learning disability treatment that <strong>PBS did an hour-long documentary on our findings.</strong> IQ-Express is the translation of our methods into a DVD format. This is a program designed by caring professionals to be used in your own home and on your schedule. There is no audience of peers to be embarrassed in front of.

								Dear Diane & Loretta,</br>
								I continue to be amazed and thrilled with the progress that Lucas has made since completing the Learning Technics program. I have taken every opportunity to tell Lucas' teachers and others involved with his initial reading evaluation about Learning Technics and the wonderful results that Lucas achieved under your guidance.</br>
								I spoke today with a young lady who is a student teacher in his classroom. She told me that she had read with Lucas several times and had not been aware that he had ever had any problems whatsoever with reading. When he started 5th grade this school year his teacher's initial evaluation of his reading speed was 70 WPM. That was a few weeks before we really hit the reading phase using the Learning Technics strategies. On several occasions since then, she has said to me, "Whatever you did with him surely worked!"</br>
								I send my warmest thanks to you for the wonderful work that you're doing. I feel so blessed to have found you!</br>
								Sincerely,
								<small>Karen</small>

							<blockquote>
								Dear John & Sally,</br>
								I wanted to send you a short note and let you know that Haylee is on a roll this year. She is now in Junior High and has all A's in her classes. Her self-esteem is soaring!</br>
								This is such a contrast to the years before Learning Technics. Even though she used her best effort, school was really difficult for her.</br>
								We want to send our sincere thanks to you and Sally. You have changed her life and her future.</br>
								Sincerely,
								<small>Kandice</small>

							<blockquote>
								Dear Kathleen,</br>
								I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for all the help you gave Paul. Your program really works and I'm so happy and thankful that we found you.</br>
								When I pulled Paul out of school a year ago to start homeschool, they had tested him as reading on a second grade level (Paul was 15). I even wondered about that, as he couldn't read one sentence of the easiest book without stumbling.</br>
								They tested all the students last week and Paul tested at a 7.5 reading level. I knew he was reading so much better. When he found out his reading level, he was totally astounded and his confidence has soared through the roof!</br>
								I called his dad and told him and he was so overcome, we both ended up in tears. A simple thanks to you seems so little, but we give you our deepest heartfelt thanks. You have made a whole new life for our son.</br>
								Sincerely,
								<small>Jane</small>
